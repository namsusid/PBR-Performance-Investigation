# PBR-Performance-Investigation
# Introduction 
The performance of a pilot scale PBR enveloped by a heat exchanger is investigated. Analyses and calculations are conducted to make recommendations for operating conditions of the reactor whic yield the highest conversion. 
# The Analysis
Firstly, the kinetics of the reaction occuring inside the PBR are determined using data fitting. Next, the Thiele Modulus and the the effectiveness of the catalyst used are found. Finally, the conversion, the pressure drop, and the exit temperature of the coolant from the heat exchanger are determined and their characteristic plots are plotted.
# Summary of Findings 
Increasing the reactor operating temperature by 50 K is recommended to increase the conversion. It is also recommende to increase the inlet concentration of reactant A by 3 M. Both if these changes combined increase the conversion of the reactor by 59%.
